    will be deleted when you have not accessed QuickSight in 30 days.

    You can keep your user by logging in and taking actions in QuickSight. 
    Alternatively, you can do nothing, and your user will be automatically deleted. 
    Never fear, you simply log back into QuickSight and enter your e-mail, and your user gets recreated. 
    No dashboards or other resources will be deleted at this time (we may clean those up in the future, with notification, of course).<br /><br />
